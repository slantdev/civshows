            Since 1952, the Caravan Trades & Industries Association Victoria (trading as Caravan Industry Victoria, (CIV)) has been the trusted voice of Victoria’s caravan and camping industry. We proudly advocate for, support, and represent our members, helping them grow while promoting the joys of caravanning and camping to the wider community.

          <p>
            CIV was originally founded by caravan manufacturers, hirers, and enthusiasts drawn to the “family lifestyle” that caravanning offers. Today, we have over 250 members, spanning manufacturers, retailers, and service providers. Did you know that 93% of the more than 31,000 caravans and RVs made in Australia are manufactured right here in Victoria? That means most businesses in the industry rely on Victoria for their supply chain, making us the heartland for innovation and quality with in the caravan industry.
